    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implemented Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Perceptron classifiers.\n",
    "* Preprocessed images by resizing to 64Ã—64 pixels, flattening, normalizing, and scaling.\n",
    "* Trained on 2000 labeled images and tested on 10 test images.\n",
    "* Used tuned parameters: Logistic Regression (`max_iter=1000`), KNN (`n_neighbors=5`), Perceptron (`max_iter=1000`, `tol=1e-3`).\n",

    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model               | Test Accuracy |\n",
    "| ------------------- | ------------- |\n",
    "| Logistic Regression | 60%           |\n",
    "| KNN                 | 50%           |\n",

    "* Logistic Regression had the highest accuracy on the test set and was saved as the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tested on 7 internet images:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The best model (logistic regression) correctly predicted some images but misclassified others (e.g., predicted some cats as dogs).\n",
    "  * KNN and Perceptron predictions varied, sometimes correctly classifying images where logistic regression failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "* Logistic Regression performed best overall but was not fully reliable on unseen internet images.\n",
    "* KNN and Perceptron showed inconsistent but occasionally complementary predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The Logistic Regression model achieved the best test accuracy but struggled with some real-world internet images. While reasonably effective, the model is prone to errors, suggesting the need for more robust features or advanced methods for improved generalization."
